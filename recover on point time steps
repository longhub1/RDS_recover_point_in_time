# Creating an SQL Database in Amazon RDS

## Overview
This guide details the steps to create an SQL database named **rds-test** in Amazon RDS, hosted in the Mumbai region, with a backup retention of 7 days and point-in-time recovery enabled.

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account.
- Basic knowledge of AWS Management Console.

## Steps to Create the Database

### Step 1: Log in to AWS Management Console
1. Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
2. Sign in with your AWS credentials.

### Step 2: Navigate to Amazon RDS
1. In the AWS Management Console, search for **RDS** in the services search bar.
2. Click on **RDS** to open the RDS dashboard.

### Step 3: Create a Database
1. Click on the **Databases** option in the left sidebar.
2. Click the **Create database** button.

### Step 4: Choose Database Creation Method
1. Select **Standard Create**.
2. Choose your desired **Database Engine** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

### Step 5: Configure Database Settings
1. **Templates**: Choose a template (e.g., Production).
2. **DB Instance Identifier**: Enter `rds-test`.
3. **Master Username**: Specify a username (e.g., `admin`).
4. **Master Password**: Create a strong password for your database user.

### Step 6: Configure DB Instance Specifications
1. **DB Instance Class**: Select an instance class suitable for your workload.
2. **Storage**: Set the allocated storage size (e.g., 20 GB).
3. **Storage Type**: Choose between General Purpose (SSD) or Provisioned IOPS.

### Step 7: Set Backup and Maintenance Options
1. **Backup**:
   - Enable **Automated Backups**.
   - Set **Backup Retention Period** to `7 days`.
2. **Point-In-Time Recovery**:
   - Ensure Automated Backups are enabled to allow for point-in-time recovery.

### Step 8: Configure VPC and Security
1. **VPC**: Select the appropriate Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
2. **Subnet Group**: Choose a subnet group that includes the necessary availability zones.
3. **Public Access**: Decide if you want your DB to be publicly accessible (typically set to No for security).
4. **VPC Security Groups**: Configure inbound rules to allow access from your IP or other sources.

### Step 9: Additional Configuration
1. **Database Options**: Configure any necessary database parameters.
2. **Monitoring**: Optionally, enable Enhanced Monitoring for performance insights.

### Step 10: Review and Create
1. Review all configurations and settings.
2. Click on **Create database**.

### Step 11: Wait for Database Availability
- Monitor the creation process. Once the status shows **Available**, the database is ready for use.

### Step 12: Access Your Database
- Use a SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin) to connect to `rds-test`.

## Scenario: Restoring Database due to Corruption

### Problem
Suppose your database becomes corrupt due to an unexpected issue (e.g., accidental deletion of critical data or application malfunction).

### Solution: Restore to Point in Time
1. **Go to the RDS Dashboard**:
   - In the RDS dashboard, click on **Databases**.
   - Select your database instance (`rds-test`).

2. **Initiate Restore Process**:
   - Click on the **Actions** dropdown.
   - Choose **Restore to point in time**.

3. **Select Restore Time**:
   - In the restore options, specify the date and time you want to restore the database to. Make sure this time is before the corruption occurred.
   - Optionally, choose to create a new DB instance or overwrite the existing one.

4. **Review and Restore**:
   - Review the settings.
   - Click **Restore DB Instance** to begin the restoration process.

5. **Wait for Restoration**:
   - Monitor the progress in the dashboard. The status will change to **Available** once the restoration is complete.

6. **Access the Restored Database**:
   - Connect to the restored database instance using your SQL client and verify that your data is intact.

## Conclusion
You have successfully created an SQL database named **rds-test** in Amazon RDS, hosted in the Mumbai region, with 7-day backup retention and point-in-time recovery enabled. In case of corruption, you can easily restore your database to a previous state using the point-in-time recovery feature.
